# Mobile-Application-Dev2





3rd Year Mobile Application Development 2 Module. 
Focusing on C# and the UWP platform.


## Project summary

In this project I set out to build an app that made use of Local Storage as well as two of the suggested additional API's:

+ Gyroscope
+ Sound
+ Localisation
+ GPS

###### Technology Used
The project was written and developed in C# targeted towards the UWP family of devices. Currently the app is supported for running on W10 Desktop, Mobile and Xbox.

The project itself is localised in 10 languages using microsofts machine learning extension to visual studio, otherwise known as the Multilingual App Kit 

Part of the submission requires me to answer the question "Why would someone open this a second time "

Users would open this app a second and subsequent times for quick relief from disturbances in there life. The use of the app is not just limited to users who hear phantom noises, it can also be used for when absolute concentration is needed. A phrase 'wired-in' is used alot to describe a worker who is in focus mode, with music to drone out external sound and be more productive. This app can provide a means for users who want to be 'wired in' but do not want to listen to music.
 
#### Getting the app
To use the app you can download the repo or you can download the app offically at.

At the time of submission the app is still in certificition with Microsoft however the store link when live will be : 

### How to use

Upon launch the application a homepage appears with a side menu which has a number of options.

##### Sound Therapy.
Navagating to the sound therapy page present an interface for the playback of binaural beats. The objective of this section of the app is to provide a beat to the user which is composed of various frequencies at different HZ levels. This stimulation of certian Hz frequencies tricks the mind and draws focus to it and away from any phantom noises. 

There are a number of different audio files which can be selected. Each one works at a different frequency. 

##### Feedback
One of the pages allows for in-house feedback gathering. This intended use for this is to take suggestions from the userbase on what features should be added/ altered to better suit their tastes.



## Conclusion

All in all I feel the project went to plan and I was able to get the functionality I wanted too. Over the course of development I had an additional idea for an enchancement in which users could take an audiogram in-app. As the app enters the market I intend to add this as a future feautre if there is demand.
